[HEXATE]: Ira 

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
[chanting] Ira Ira!

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
[IRA]: Right. It’s happening. I have got to move this shit around.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
[HEXATE]: Ira?
What are you doing Ira?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
[IRA]: It’s got to go. This – look. Sick of it.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
I just need it to be - not this anymore.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
[HEXATE]: Are you tired Ira?
[IRA]: No.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
[HEXATE]: You don’t miss sleep?
[IRA]: I’m not tired.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
For fucks sake!

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
[Sudden loud knock]

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
[HOUSEMATE]: [Shouting] OI IRA! Go to sleep!

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
[HEXATE]: You seem a little agitated Ira
Jumpy... Anger, or...

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Was it the banging of his fist on your door?
Familiar…

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
[snickering] What do you call a girl who hasn’t slept in days?

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
[IRA]: I’m going for a walk.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
[HEXATE]: Try again

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
That sort of attention seeking won’t help
What do you say?

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
What do you call a girl who hasn’t slept in days?
