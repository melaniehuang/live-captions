# live-captions
As part of an accessibility grant I was asked to create some captions that could be displayed as a integrated part of the stage design and performance. 

This project is set up with the intention of building an open-source version to provide communities with the opportunity to easily create and display captions live. 

All you need is a script, a keyboard and a screen/projector
